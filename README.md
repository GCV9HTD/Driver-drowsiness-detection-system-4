# Driver-drowsiness-detection-system
This is a Python code for drowsiness detection system using Haar Cascades. 
Here we have used the OpenCV library to monitor the real-time video of the driver and to detect the face and the eyes of the driver. 
We use the eye-aspect-ratio (EAR) to compute the ratio between the vertical and the horizontal distance of the eyes to determine if the eyes are open or closed.
